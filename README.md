<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>For this project I have created a Rock Paper Scissors game. This game utilizes HTML & CSS, with the main purpose of this project is to show the JavaScript skills I have learnt from the Code Institute module. The aim of the game is for the user to player the computer in a game of chance, the site's goal is to create a entertaining game for the player and challenging them to beat the computer. </p>
<h3>Rules:</h3>
<p>The user chooses between Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer will randomly do the same. 
<ul>
<li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
<li>Paper beats Rock</li>
<li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
</ul>
There is an infinte amount of goes on this game so you can keep playing as much as you would like. 
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>I plan to include the following features:
<ul>
<li>The ability to play against the computer</li>
<li>Colour coding so if you win, tie or loose it will show either, green, yellow or orange to indicate your result</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<p>I plan to incorporate the following into the user experience:
<ul>
<li>A game that is easy to understand and entertaining for the user</li>
<li>Make the game visually appealing to the user with complimentary colors and icons</li>
<li>The game should work without any bugs or faults</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>I used Coolors to get a complimentary palette to add to the visual experience of the user. I used the following: 
<ul>
<li>#264653 - dark blue</li>
<li>#264653 - teal</li>
<li>#264653 - yellow</li>
<li>#264653 - peach</li>
<li>#264653 - orange</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Unfixed Bugs</h2>
<p>There a couple of things I would like to change to the site and resolve going forward. I would like to add a counter score so that the user can see their score against the computer. I would also like to add Lizard and Spock into the game to make this more interesting and entertaining for the users. 
Another thing I would like to change would be the arrangement of the text once you know you have won/tie/lost, I would like it to read "Your choice vs Computer choice" with the icons from the game. I have left it as it is at the moment with both choices going underneath eachother</p>
